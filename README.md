ifsogui.mod
===========

Marcus Trisdale's BlitzMax GUI module v1.18. Includes GUI form editor source and examples.

Extract ifsogui.mod to your BlitzMax/mod folder.

The Skin2 folder can be incbin'd using incbinSkin.bmx found in the editor folder.

There are crash issues when loading media from zip files, but incbin works fine.
