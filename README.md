ifsogui.mod
===========

Marcus Trisdale's IfSo BlitzMax GUI module v1.18. Includes GUI form editor source and examples.

Extract ifsogui.mod to your BlitzMax/mod folder.

The Skin2 folder can be incbin'd using incbinSkin.bmx now found in the editor folder.

See the examples folder to get started, each module is also well documented.

There are crash issues when loading media from zip files, but incbin works fine.
