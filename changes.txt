**Changes since 1.12**
All gadgets now have a Destroy() method that will break references between the gadget and its children/slaves.

The GUI.RemoveGadget() function now has an optional bDestroy integer parameter that tells whether the gadget should have Destroy called on it.  This parameter defaults to True.  If you wish to Remove a gadget from the GUI, but keep it to use later, set this parameter to False.

The RemoveChild() method of all gadgets now has a bDestroy integer parameter that tells whether the gadget being removed should have Destroy called on it.  THis parameter defaults to True.  If you wish to remove a child gadget but keep it to use later, set the is parameter to false.

The Tabber gadget RemoveTabChild() method also now has the optional bDestroy parameter which defaults to True and is used in the same manner.

These changes have been made to solve some circular reference issues which were causing a memory leak.

Button
 - Buttons now emit the MouseDown and MouseUp events as well as MouseClick.

TextBox/MLTextbox
 - Filter now only filters printable chars, not backspace, enter, arrows, etc.

Panels
 - Panels now can now have a background image. SetBackgroundImage(TImage)
 -  - You can use SetAutoSize:
 -  - ifsoGUI_IMAGE_NONE - No AutoSizing
 -  - ifsoGUI_IMAGE_SCALETOPANEL - Image scales to fit the panel.
 -  - ifsoGUI_IMAGE_RESIZETOIMAGE - Panel resizes to the size of the Image.

 -  - ifsoGUI_IMAGE_CENTER - Image is centered to the panel.
 -  - This basically becomes an ImageBox type gadget.  To make a large image that you can scroll around and view, all you have to do is put a panel with a background image set to RESIZTOIMAGE, into another panel.  Then the parent panels scrollbars will appear and you can scroll around and look at the entire image.
 -  - You can grab the Images pixmap and draw on it as well.

**Changes since 1.03**

ifsoGUI
 - ifsoGUI now can use incbin to store/load the skins.
 - A sample incbinSkin.bmx file can be found in the ifsogui.mod folder, include this file at the top of your program to incbin all graphics in a skin.  Do not forget to edit the paths with the path of your skin.  Also, remove any lines pertaining to graphics file you are not using.
 - Use GUI.SetUseIncBin(True) to tell the GUI to load all files using incbin.
 - Skins can now be zipped.  And they can be zipped and incbin'ed.
 - If you incbin a zip file, then you do not need to incbin all of the individual files.
 - Zip files can be password protected.

 - Use GUI.SetZipInfo(strFile, strPassword) to tell the GUI to load files from a zip file.
